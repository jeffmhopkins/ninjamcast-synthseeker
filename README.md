Forked for SynthSeeker Community




NINJAMCast - Synthseeker Fork
 * Forked, added a config file point for block size to combat crackles and pops without having to recompile ninjamcast every time.


 ---------------------------------------

 
You'll need the following libs and packages installed for it to compile correctly:

```
gcc-4.3-multilib
lib32ncurses5 
lib32ncurses5-dev
libasound2
libasound2-dev
libvorbis
libvorbis0a
libvorbisenc2
lib ogg 
lib mp3lame
```
Maybe a few more... compiles and runs on Ubuntu as of 5/20/2024
